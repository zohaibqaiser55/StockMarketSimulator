# StockMarketSimulator
A stock market simulation in java using design patterns

I have used three design patterns in this project
1 - Singleton
    for the data class that stores all the data related to the stock market
2 - Observer
    for syncronising the stock prices of all the companies and the data class
3 - Chain of responsibility
    for the trading since there are steps involved to run the stock market with rules applied for efficiency
